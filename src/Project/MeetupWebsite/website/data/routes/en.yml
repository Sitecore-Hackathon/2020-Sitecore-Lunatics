# This is a route layout definition.
# The route definition defines which Sitecore components are present on a route,
# what their content data is, and which _placeholder_ they are placed in.

# This particular route definition is for the home route - '/', so it defines the
# components shown on the initial page of the app.

# You may use equivalent JSON files instead of YAML if you prefer;
# however YAML is simpler to read and allows comments like this one :)

# Setting an ID is optional, but it will allow referring to this item in internal links
# the ID can be a app-wide-unique string, or a GUID value.
id: home-page

# Route-level fields are appropriate for page level data like <title> contents
# Define route level fields in /sitecore/definitions/routes.sitecore
fields:
  pageTitle: Welcome to Sitecore Meetup Official Web site
# Define the page layout starting at the root placeholder - in this case, 'jss-main'
# root placeholder names are defined in the package.json config section (required for Sitecore deployment)
